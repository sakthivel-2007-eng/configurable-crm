# Configurable CRM

A multi-tenant, fully configurable sales CRM. Every workspace defines its own
lead fields, pipeline stages, call dispositions, custom actions and permission
templates through the settings UI at runtime — **the codebase ships no business
taxonomy of its own.**

New to the project? Read [`EXPLAIN-SIMPLE.md`](EXPLAIN-SIMPLE.md) first, then
[`docs/03-configuration-model.md`](docs/03-configuration-model.md), which is the
authoritative product spec. The rules that must never be broken live in
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

**Current status: M0 — scaffold.** The stack stands up, `/health` reports on its
backing services, and the toolchain is wired end to end. There are no domain
models, no tables and no API surface beyond `/health` yet; those begin at M1. See
[`docs/00-milestones.md`](docs/00-milestones.md).

---

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Backend | Python 3.12 · FastAPI · Pydantic v2 · pydantic-settings |
| ORM / migrations | SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async) + Alembic |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 |
| Cache / queue | Redis 7 (background work lands with `arq` later) |
| Object storage | S3-compatible — MinIO locally |
| Frontend | React 18 · TypeScript · Vite · Tailwind CSS v4 · shadcn/ui |
| Data fetching | TanStack Query v5 |
| Backend tests | pytest · pytest-asyncio · httpx · testcontainers |
| E2E | Playwright |
| Lint / format | ruff · mypy (strict) · eslint · prettier · pre-commit |

Dependencies are managed with **uv** (Python) and **pnpm** (frontend).

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Needed for |
|---|---|---|
| [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) + Compose | v2+ | the whole stack, and the test containers |
| [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | 0.5+ | the API outside Docker |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) | 22+ | the web app outside Docker |
| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) | 11+ | `corepack enable` provides it |

Docker alone is enough for the quick start.

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <repo> && cd configurable-crm
cp .env.example .env          # optional — compose has local defaults for every value
docker compose up --build
```

That brings up Postgres, Redis, MinIO, the API and the web app. Wait for the API
health check to go green, then:

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Web app (system status page) | http://localhost:5173 |
| API health | http://localhost:8000/health |
| API docs (local only) | http://localhost:8000/docs |
| MinIO console | http://localhost:9001 |

A green `/health` looks like this:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "Configurable CRM API",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "environment": "local",
  "checks": {
    "database":       { "status": "ok", "latency_ms": 3.1,  "error": null },
    "redis":          { "status": "ok", "latency_ms": 1.4,  "error": null },
    "object_storage": { "status": "ok", "latency_ms": 12.7, "error": null }
  }
}
```

If any backing service fails its probe the endpoint returns **503** with
`"status": "degraded"` and the failure detail on the offending component, rather
than a bare error — so the status page can tell you *which* dependency is down.
Error text is redacted outside `local`/`test`, because driver errors can echo a
DSN.

`/health` is mounted twice: at `/health` for container and load-balancer probes,
and at `/api/v1/health` for API clients. Only the versioned one appears in the
OpenAPI schema.

Stop and wipe:

```bash
docker compose down --volumes
```

---

## Developing outside Docker

Keep the infrastructure in Docker and run the app processes on the host.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d postgres redis minio minio-init
```

**API** — `.env` already points `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL` and `S3_ENDPOINT_URL`
at `localhost`:

```bash
cd api
uv sync
uv run alembic upgrade head          # M1: tenancy, auth and user lifecycle
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

**Web:**

```bash
cd web
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

---

## Checks

Everything CI runs, runnable locally:

```bash
cd api && uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run mypy app && uv run pytest
cd web && pnpm lint && pnpm format:check && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test:e2e
```

`pytest` starts a real **Postgres 16 container** via testcontainers — Docker must
be running. SQLite is not an option here: JSONB and expression indexes, which the
data model leans on from M2 onward, do not behave the same way.

Without Docker, point the suite at any Postgres 16+ you already have:

```bash
createdb crm_test
cd api && TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@localhost:5432/crm_test uv run pytest
```

CI leaves `TEST_DATABASE_URL` unset so it always runs against the pinned
Postgres 16 image.

The migration is checked separately — it must apply, match the models, and roll
back:

```bash
cd api
uv run alembic upgrade head
uv run alembic check        # fails if the models and the revision have drifted
uv run alembic downgrade base
```

Playwright needs its browser once per machine:

```bash
cd web && pnpm exec playwright install chromium
```

### Pre-commit hooks

```bash
uvx pre-commit install          # once per clone
uvx pre-commit run --all-files  # ad hoc
```

The hooks shell out to the project's own toolchain, so tool versions have a
single source of truth in `api/pyproject.toml` and `web/package.json`.

### CI

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs three jobs on every
push and pull request:

| Job | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `api` | ruff, ruff format, mypy strict, pytest against a real Postgres |
| `web` | eslint, prettier, `tsc --noEmit`, production build, Playwright |
| `stack` | `docker compose up` from a clean checkout, then `/health` green |

Directories that arrive with later milestones — `tenancy/`, `auth/`, `fields/`,
`models/`, `permissions/`, `events/`, `seed/` on the API side, and `features/` on
the web side — are laid out in `CLAUDE.md`. They are deliberately absent until
the milestone that needs them.

---

## Configuration

All configuration is environment-driven through `pydantic-settings`; there are no
hardcoded URLs or secrets. [`.env.example`](.env.example) documents every
variable. `DATABASE_URL` must use the `postgresql+asyncpg://` driver — the
engine is async, and a sync DSN is rejected at startup rather than failing
confusingly at the first query.

Note what is **not** here: a workspace's country code, timezone, currency and
taxonomy are database rows, not environment variables. Nothing about any
customer's business belongs in configuration files either.

---

## Conventions

- **API paths** — `/api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/{resource}` for tenant data;
  `/api/v1/auth/*` and `/api/v1/me/*` are unscoped
- **Python** — snake_case, full type hints, mypy strict on `app/`
- **TypeScript** — no `any`; types derive from the API's OpenAPI schema
- **Migrations** — one Alembic revision per milestone; never edit an applied one,
  and never generate DDL at runtime
- **Errors** — `HTTPException` with `detail.code` and `detail.message`
- **Commits** — conventional commits, one logical unit each
- **Never commit** `.env`, real customer data, or any real phone number or email

The full set, including the architecture rules that are not negotiable, is in
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).
