"""API-key authentication for the intake path (M10).

A key is a machine credential with the blast radius of a password: it can create
leads in a customer's workspace and, through its permission template, read
whatever that template grants. So it is generated with `secrets`, stored as an
Argon2 hash, and shown exactly once.

**The prefix is the lookup key.** Hashing is deliberately slow, so verifying a
presented key against every row in the table would be a denial-of-service
primitive — an attacker with one bad key could pin a CPU per request. The
plaintext prefix narrows it to (almost always) one candidate before any hashing
happens, and it is short enough to be useless on its own.

**A wrong key still pays for one hash.** Returning early on "no such prefix"
would leak, by timing, which prefixes exist. The dummy verify keeps the two
paths comparable, exactly as the login path does.
