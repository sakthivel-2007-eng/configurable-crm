"""Outbound delivery, retry and the DEAD threshold (M10).

The milestone's acceptance criterion is *"kill the worker mid-delivery and show
a retry rather than a lost event"*, so this module is organised around surviving
its own death.

**A claim is committed before the HTTP call.** The row moves to `DELIVERING`
with `claimed_at` set, and that transaction commits. If the process dies during
the request, the row is still `DELIVERING` — visible, attributable, and
reclaimable — rather than sitting in `PENDING` while another worker sends it a
second time, or being lost with an in-memory transaction.

**A stale claim is reclaimed, not abandoned.** Any row in `DELIVERING` older
than `CLAIM_TIMEOUT` is assumed to belong to a dead worker and becomes eligible
again. That is the retry the criterion asks for: no coordination, no leader
election, just a timeout that a crashed worker cannot refresh.

**This makes delivery at-least-once, deliberately.** A worker can die *after* the
consumer accepted and *before* the commit, and the event will be sent again.
That is why `event_id` is stable across retries — the consumer dedupes. The
alternative, at-most-once, loses events, and losing a lead event is worse than
sending it twice.

**Backoff is `2^attempts` minutes capped at 60; DEAD after 8.** That is roughly
four hours of trying, which covers an ordinary deploy or outage, after which a
human decides rather than the queue grinding forever.
