"""Structured logging, error reporting and metrics (M11).

Three things the product had none of, and one idea holding them together: when
something goes wrong in a multi-tenant system, "what broke" is half an answer.
The other half is **whose** — and until now a stack trace could not say.

**Every log line carries a request id and, once resolved, a workspace id.**
Bound to a context variable rather than passed down, because the interesting
lines are emitted deep inside services that have no business taking a logging
parameter. A caller correlates a support report to a request; the workspace id
turns "the CRM is slow" into "this tenant's queries are slow".

**Sentry and Prometheus are both optional.** No DSN, no Sentry; nobody scraping,
nothing scraped. Neither may become a reason the API will not start — an
observability dependency that can take the product down has inverted its own
purpose.

**The five metrics are the ones named in the milestone**, and four of them
measure the asynchronous machinery M8 and M10 built. Request duration is the
obvious one; outbox depth, intake rate, index-build queue and scheduler lag are
the ones nobody can see by looking at the app, which is precisely why they are
the ones worth exporting.
