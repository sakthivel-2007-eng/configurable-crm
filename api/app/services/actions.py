"""The action-writing service (M5).

PROMPTS.md M5: "Write the action-writing service and its tests FIRST, before any
endpoint." This is why — every lead mutation in the product funnels through
here, and the guarantees it makes are the ones M7's undo and M6's history
filters are built on:

1. **Every mutation opens a changeset** (architecture rule 5a). Single edit,
   bulk edit, import, distribution, intake — all of them. Every action produced
   carries the `changeset_id`.
2. **Every mutation writes its actions in the same transaction as the change**
   (rule 5). The timeline is the audit trail; a timeline that can diverge from
   the data is not one.
3. **`STAGE_CHANGE` and `ASSIGNMENT_CHANGE` carry old and new ids** (rule 5b),
   because M6's transition filters query them through expression indexes.
4. **`score_applied` is snapshotted**, so editing a custom action type's score
   later does not rewrite history.

Nothing here commits. The caller owns the transaction boundary, which is what
lets a lead update and its four actions land atomically.
