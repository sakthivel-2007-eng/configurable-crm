"""The assignment engine (M8).

`04-feature-coverage.md`: *"A telecalling CRM without automatic distribution is
a spreadsheet."* This module is that distribution. It answers one question —
**who should this lead go to?** — and it is the only thing in the codebase that
answers it, because it is called from every create path there is.

Four decisions are worth reading before changing anything here.

**The cursor is locked, not read.** Round-robin state lives in one row per rule.
The obvious implementation reads the row, computes the next member, and writes
it back; under two concurrent inserts both transactions read position 4 and both
hand the lead to the fifth rep, and the sixth rep gets nothing. The fix is a row
lock — `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` — which serialises the pair. This is invisible in
any single-threaded test, so `test_assignment.py` runs a genuinely concurrent
one. It is the single most likely defect in this milestone.

**Rules are the M6 filter DSL, evaluated in Postgres.** Not a second condition
language, and not a Python re-implementation of the first. The engine compiles
each rule to the same SQL a saved view compiles to and asks it about one lead
id. That means a history predicate — "no call logged in 7 days" — works in an
assignment rule for free, and means there is exactly one place where a filter
can be wrong.

**Rules compile with system grants, not the caller's.** A rule authored by an
admin routes on whatever fields the admin chose. If it compiled against the
grants of whoever happened to create the lead, a rule on Budget would silently
stop matching for a caller who cannot see Budget, and identical leads would
route differently depending on who typed them in. Routing is not a read of
customer data by that caller — nothing about the rule's fields reaches them —
so the correct projection is the system's.

**Candidates must be able to log in.** `skip_unavailable` is the documented
switch and it filters on `availability`, but an unlicensed member cannot log in
at all, so assigning to one buries the lead where nobody will ever see it.
Unlicensed members are skipped unconditionally, whatever the flag says.
