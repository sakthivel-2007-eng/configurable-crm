"""Importing a spreadsheet (M7).

`04-feature-coverage.md` found four distinct flows hiding behind "upload an
Excel", and treating them as one is what produced a mapping screen that could
express none of them properly. They are separate `ImportJobKind`s here:

| Kind | What it is |
|---|---|
| `LEAD_IMPORT` | Create or update, keyed on the workspace's identity field |
| `LEAD_UPDATE` | Update only. A row whose identity matches nothing *fails*
  rather than quietly creating a lead — the entire difference, and the reason
  a separate kind exists |
| `ACTION_IMPORT` | Historical timeline migration. Every customer switching CRMs needs it |
| `EXPORT` | The other direction, sharing the job record |

**Distribution and owner assignment are options on a run, not flows of their
own.** "Excel Advance Distribution" and "Owner Specific Assignment" are both
answers to "who gets these leads", so they are one setting with several
strategies rather than two more import types.

Three rules the whole module is built around:

1. **Mapping is limited to fields the caller has `Import` on *and* that carry
   `show_in_import`.** Both, not either. `FieldWriteFilter.check_import` is the
   gate and it refuses rather than dropping.
2. **The dry run and the commit read the same file through the same code.** A
   preview that came from a different path than the write is a preview of
   something else.
3. **A whole run is one changeset**, so a bad import is one undo.
