Every read here goes through `FieldProjectionService` and every write through

The mutation shape is the same everywhere:

           "undo that mistake" 500 separate decisions.

           write filter for every lead, and the filter refuses rather than
           dropping — so a forbidden field fails the batch on the first lead
           instead of writing 200 leads and then stopping.
        3. **Capped.** 500 per the contract. A request that would touch more is
           refused with the cap named, not silently truncated to the first 500 —
           truncation would report success over work it did not do.
