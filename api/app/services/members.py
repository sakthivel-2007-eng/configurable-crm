"""Member lifecycle: invite, licence, availability, deactivate, reactivate.

Every method takes a `ScopedSession`, so none of them can address a membership
in another workspace — including the reassignment target, which is the one that
would hurt most if it could.

Two rules are enforced here rather than in the router, because both have to hold
whichever path reaches them:

- **A licence is a seat.** Assigning one past `seat_limit` is a 409, not a
  silent overage.
- **Deactivation never orphans a pipeline.** A member holding open leads cannot
  be deactivated without a reassignment target.
