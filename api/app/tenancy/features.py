"""Per-workspace feature flags (M3).

`docs/03-configuration-model.md` §5 and CLAUDE.md's known traps:

> **Feature flags must gate endpoints, not just navigation.** A disabled
> feature returns 403, it doesn't merely hide a menu item.

Hiding a menu item is a cosmetic change that any client can undo with a URL. If
`campaign` is off for a workspace, `POST /campaigns` must refuse — otherwise the
flag is decoration and the workspace is paying for a boundary that does not
exist.

Used as a dependency factory:

    @router.get("/campaigns", dependencies=[Depends(require_feature("campaign"))])

The flag set is declared here because it is a *product* concept — the list of
modules this product can switch off. What each workspace turns on is a row.
