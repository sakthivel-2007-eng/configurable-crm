"""The cross-workspace isolation matrix for M1.

Three families of probe, because a tenancy leak has three shapes:

1. **By direct id** — A asks for B's resource by its real uuid.
2. **By list** — A lists a collection and B's rows must not appear in it.
3. **By filter/reference** — A submits B's id as a *parameter* to a write in A,
   which is the leak that survives naive `WHERE workspace_id` filtering: the
   read is scoped, but the foreign key is not.

Every direct-id probe asserts 404 specifically, not merely "an error". A 403
would confirm existence.
