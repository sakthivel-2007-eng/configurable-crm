"""The outbound event bus (M10).

The milestone's acceptance criterion is *"kill the worker mid-delivery and show
a retry rather than a lost event"*, so the first test simulates exactly that: a
row left in `DELIVERING` by a process that never came back, and a later pass
that picks it up.

The rest cover the properties a consumer depends on — a stable `event_id` across
retries, a signature over the exact bytes sent, backoff, the DEAD threshold —
and the one a *customer* depends on: that a webhook payload is projected through
the endpoint's template, so the bus is not a hole in the field matrix.
