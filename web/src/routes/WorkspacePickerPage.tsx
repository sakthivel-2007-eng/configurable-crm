/**
 * Choose which workspace to work in.
 *
 * Memberships without a licence, or that have been deactivated, are listed but
 * not selectable — showing them with a reason is more useful than hiding them,
 * because "where did my workspace go?" is the support ticket that follows.
 *
 * This route always renders, even when there is only one usable workspace.
 * Login already skips the picker in that case; short-circuiting *here* as well
 * would mean the one person who most needs to see "no licensed seat" — someone
 * with exactly one working workspace and one broken one — could never reach
 * the page that says so.
